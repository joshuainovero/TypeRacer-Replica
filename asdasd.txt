From what I understand in literature as intertextual or self-reflexive construct.
Intertextuality is simply the inheritance of literatures from other literatures. 
It creates new interpretations as it introduces new context or idea from other literatures.
It also allows people to write their own literatures based on what they've learned from other
authors.
